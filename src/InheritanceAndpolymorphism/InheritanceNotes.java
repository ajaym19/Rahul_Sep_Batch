	 * Inheritance
	 * passing the properties from one generation to another
	 * 
	 * to give information to JAVA
	 * who the parent is
	 * and who the child is
	 * we use extend keyword
	 * 
	 * From child class object, we can access all the method of Parent class
	 * but from parent class object, we cannot access child class methods
	 * 
	 * Object Class is the parent of all classes
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Multiple Inheritance is not possible in JAVA using classes
	 * 
	 * Polymorphism:
	 * poly? multiple/many
	 * morphism: forms
	 * 
	 * 2 types
	 * 1. Method Overriding (Run Time):  
	 * 2. Method Overloading (Compile Time):
